# Web Launcher

This is a web interface for a Attack-Defend CTF exploit launcher.

# Installation

This was created using python3 but does not make use of many python3 specific features so it should run with few modifications on python2. To install the dependencies type `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then simply type `./run.py`.
